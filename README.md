Recipe Page Challenge

This a summary of what I learned and what the process of building the omelet page recipe website was like.

<-------- WHAT DID I LEARNED?-------->

It was my first project. So it is hard to imagine "how I will start?", because I always watched classes to make things happen or I just repeated what my teacher was doing. I can say autonomy was the main lesson I learned from this project.

Regard the language used in programming, some HTML tags, such as body tag, was a great challenge and a huge sucess. I learned how to work with it after many mistakes. Especially in this part: 

<table width="50%">
        <tr>
          <td>Calories</td>
          <td class="line">277kcal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Carbs</td>
          <td class="line">0g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Protein</td>
          <td class="line">20g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fat</td>
          <td class="line">22g</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

The table tag was very hard to work, because I don't know how to modify a table or its rows. 
The same thing occurs with de <ol> tag, becaus I don't know how to 'bold' the initial word in the Instructions part. But I think it is a CSS problem.
<h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
    <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
    <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
    <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
    <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>

<-------CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT-------->

I need to practice this more. I mean, the CSS part was a lot more complex because I've never worked with it that much. However, I have found that I have certain shortcomings in my knowledge of HTML. 

<--------BUILT---------->

I used this resources: 
-HTML 5
-CSS 3


<---------- USEFULL RESOURCER-------->

I searched some videos on YouTube to have some ideas about the beggining of the site and what kind of tags I need to use to make my work easier.

<-----------ACKNOWLEDGEMENT------------->

Thanks to my discord colleague who gave me some tips on how to do some work with the table. The problem is that I ended up getting the command wrong and had to do it myself, but I thank you anyway for the support and patience.
